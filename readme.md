# Streamlit Project:
Question: You are tasked with creating a Data Entry application using Streamlit for managing employee and department data. 

The application should consist of three pages, each serving specific functionalities. Please see the attached screenshot named "Input" for reference. 
The Employee data entry page should allow users to input information such as Employee Number (Empno), Employee Name (Ename), Job, and Department Number (Deptno). 
The Department data entry page should enable users to input data for departments, including Department Number (Deptno), Department Name (dname), and Location (loc). 
Finally, the third page should visualize the joined employee and department data table based on the common 'Deptno' field.

The output should look like the screenshot named "output" attached as a link below. 

Design the Streamlit application to fulfill these requirements. 

The application should have a user-friendly interface, and error handling for data input, and should display appropriate success messages upon successful data submission. 

Ensure that the data entered on each page is stored in separate DataFrames (employee_data and department_data) and that the visualization page can correctly join and display the data from both DataFrames.


Please provide a Python script developingcontaining the Streamlit application code and any necessary explanations for your design choices. Also, use a virtual environment while  the project.
